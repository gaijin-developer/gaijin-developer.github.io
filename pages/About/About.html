        <p>
          I am a certified Electrical and Electronics Engineer with experience
          working as a power plant operator and an electrical compliance
          officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a semi-self-taught web developer with practical experience in
          working with some major front end technologies including HTML, CSS,
          React and JavaScript and some backend technologies such as NodeJS,
          ExpressJS and PHP as well as the MySQL database. I am dedicated to
          writing clean, concise and reliable code to perform tasks and
          implement features that satisfy the needs of customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had the idea to get into web development in early June 2021 when I
          had a conversation with a friend about exploring new ideas and skills
          and my friend suggested that we study software engineering. I did a
          little bit of research into what it meant to be a web developer and
          what it takes to be a good one. I later found a free resource that I
          could use to get started (freeCodeCamp). In the University, we had a
          course which was part of the electrical engineering curriculum -
          introduction to algorithms. What was taught in class wasn’t enough to
          properly introduce anyone to software engineering and what it entails.

          In late June 2021, I started learning web development from
          freeCodeCamp through their responsive web design course. When I
          created my first app using just HTML (Cat Photo App) my eyes were
          opened to the endless possibilities and power this skill could offer
          me, I was so happy about being able to put the picture of the cat on
          the screen and to finally realize how all those sites I visit daily
          put pictures on their site.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was very motivated to see the course through. I was working as a
          power plant operator at the time and finding time to study was a
          headache and so was keeping the motivation but I kept taking it a day
          at a time. I was encouraged by my wife (then girlfriend at the time)
          to keep going and do my best. Studying web development while working
          fulltime wasn’t easy but I kept on giving my best till my wife (then
          girlfriend) who is Japanese and I decided to meet in Ghana. I took a
          break to prepare for her arrival and to ensure that she enjoys her
          stay. After she left, it was difficult to find time to study and
          practice because I was still working full time while preparing for our
          wedding.

        <p>
          In March 2022, I got laid off from work which was difficult to take
          because I had just gotten married but it was also a great opportunity
          to get back to coding and studying. I resumed my studies full time and
          I decided to blend freeCodeCamp with other resources like Udemy and
          YouTube. I was able to improve a lot during this time period till I
          got an electrical engineering job in June 2022 but I was still
          determined to be a web developer since I found more joy in writing
          code and building amazing systems and I was also able to impress my
          wife very often with what I build. I have been using a combination of
          freeCodeCamp, Coursera and Udemy and YouTube to learn new technologies
          and improve my knowledge up till this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a very resilient and ambitious developer and I am committed to
          providing services and writing code that is up to standard and fitting
          to meet the demands of customers. I am dedicated to continuous
          learning and improvement in the field of software engineering. I have
          the goal to be a very skilled full stack developer by the end of 2023
          with a substantial coverage of some key frontend and backend
          technologies as well as some tools such as docker. I seek to work for
          an institution/company that is willing to give me the room to reach my
          goals while making full use of my skills and knowledge. I also love to
          be challenged to go the extra mile to find the solution and I am never
          shy or embarrassed to say “I don’t know” and ask for help. I seek to
          work harder and get better every day.
